## Charlotte Thomas {#base}

### Bio {#bio}

Hi! My name is Charlotte Thomas, I'm a 22 y.o French Developer, System admin,
and general IT Specialist. I have a good job and I like it so if you're a
recruiter you do not need to send me an email.

Same if you're looking for a developer to commission please search someone else
I'm not your gal.

I love a variety of language, my languages of choice nowadays are _Rust_ and
_OCaml_. 

My favourite projects are [Calc](https://codeberg.org/vanilla-extract/calc) and
[BaguetteSharp](https://github.com/vanilla-extract/ocaml-baguettesharp-interpreter).

I like writing parsers, interpreters, and compilers. I settled into a basic
technique of _pratt-parsing_ from _Calc_ and newer projects.

### Queer {#queer}

I am a queer woman. I am (not-exaustively), intersex, lesbian, asexual,
demiromantic, and polyamorous.

If you need help from a queer person, **please**, contact me you can see
[here](#about-me) how to contact me. Especially if you're in France, I can see where I
can help you, do not hesitate to reach out, I answer pretty quickly.

### Writing {#writing}

I am also a [_writer_](https://writing.charlotte-thomas.me). I wrote a short-story, and I used to write a novel.
I scrapped this novel to write a new one, based on the same idea but rewrote
from the ground up, with improved prose grammar and everything (including real
beta-readers!). 

This new novel is _Galactic Consequences_ you can find the [_writing
blog_](https://writing.charlotte-thomas.me/blog/) here where I post the
development of the novel.
