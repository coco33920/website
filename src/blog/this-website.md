# This website

I found Sabrina Jewson's website by chance and it was wonderful so I cloned her
repo and started my writing blog on her technology!

## Constructing it {#it} 

Building the website was *very* easy thanks to her, I just cloned her GitHub
repository and changed the templates and sources. 

Everything _should be_ alright, there wasn't any license in the repo, so I added
her name everywhere. If she's not okay with me using it I will put this website
down (realistically, I would rewrite the Rust software a little differently as
to not trigger copyrights

## Content {#content}

The content of this website will be easy. An index page which has various
informations and a blog where I will post on my life and on my journey. 

Join me in this trip!
