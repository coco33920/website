My name is Charlotte, I'm 22, and I've been a Java developer for more than ten years, I
now am a functional developer in OCaml and more recently fell in love with Rust.

I'm a young queer feminist. I am intersex, trans, a lesbian and ace. Currently a
student in computer science at Rennes University.
