Baguette# pronounced "Baguette Sharp" is the programming language I developed
for my french *TIPE* in pr√©pa. It's the tastiest programming language ever and
even have its own [esolang page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Baguette) !

See how you can do your own Turing Machine Program with Baguette on [the
github](https://github.com/coco33920/ocaml-baguettesharp-interpreter)
