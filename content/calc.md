The above image shows calc, it has its own website
[here](https://calc.nwa2coco.fr) and I am now working at the symbolic
computation.

Calc is a fully featured Rust calculator, it supports a wide range of
mathematical functions and supports piping.
You can find the manual on the website or the documentation in the
book [here](https://calc.nwa2coco.fr/book)

It is on [here](https://crates.io) under the name
[mini-calc](https://crates.io/crates/mini-calc)
